### Hi there, I'm Karthik! 👋

I'm a data-driven problem solver and engineer, currently pursuing my Master's in Information Technology (Data Science) at Franklin University. I am blending my **5 years of large-scale operations and data analysis experience** from **Uber** and **Amazon**  with advanced machine learning and software engineering skills.

My background is in Computer Engineering, and I thrive on translating complex business needs into technical solutions , analyzing performance data with **SQL** and **Python** , and building efficient, automated systems.
